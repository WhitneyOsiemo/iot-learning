  # Understanding the difference between analogue and digital signals
  [difference between analog and digital signals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physics/difference-between-analog-and-digital-signal/)
  

Both are electrical signals used to transmit information in various electronic systems.
Analogue - Continuous data using a continuous range of values. Can take on any value within a certain range 
         - Circuit components- Amplifiers, filters, continuous wave oscillators
         - The signal is continuous and varies smoothly over time
Digital - represents data as a sequence of discrete values, typically using binary numbers 
        - Circuit component- Microprocessors, binary counters, logic gates
        - The signal is discrete and is represented by a series of discrete values

        Analogue to digital conversion(ADC)
        1. Pulse code modulation
           - Sampling
           - Quantization
           - Encoding
        2. Delta modulation
        3. Adaptive Delta modulation
