  # Understanding the difference between analogue and digital signals
  [Difference between analog and digital signals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physics/difference-between-analog-and-digital-signal/)
  

Both are electrical signals used to transmit information in various electronic systems.

Analogue - Continuous data using a continuous range of values. Can take on any value within a certain range.
         - Circuit components- Amplifiers, filters, continuous wave oscillators.
         - The signal is continuous and varies smoothly over time.

         
Digital - represents data as a sequence of discrete values, typically using binary numbers. 
        - Circuit component- Microprocessors, binary counters, logic gates.
        - The signal is discrete and is represented by a series of discrete values.

        Analogue to digital conversion(ADC)
        1. Pulse code modulation
           - Sampling
           - Quantization
           - Encoding
        2. Delta modulation
        3. Adaptive Delta modulation

  # Microcontrollers
  [Introduction to microcontroller](https://www.circuitbasics.com/introduction-to-microcontrolleres/)
  
  Microcontrollers read the voltage from an input device and use this information to decide on the correct voltage to output.
  -Embedded in an integrated circuit (IC)
  
          Integrated circuit - miniature electronic devices that combine multiple components.
          Integrates: Processor, program memory, RAM, input/output pins.


          -Development boards; Raspberry Pi
                               Arduino Uno

                               
      Programming microcontrollers.
            Arduino - IDE, write the Arduino code and upload it to the microcontroller via USB cable. 

  # Sensor interfacing 
  [Sensor interfacing](https://www.electronicsforu.com/technology-trends/learn-electronics/sensor-interfacing)

  Process of connecting sensors to microcontrollers or other processing systems. 
  
               It enables the microcontrollers to; 
                  -Acquire the signals from the sensors
                  - Process and interpret the data from the sensor
                  - Control devices or actuators based on the input
                  
  Principle- integrates hardware and software components to achieve accurate and reliable measurement and control.
