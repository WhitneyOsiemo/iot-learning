I have returned to the fundamentals of electronics. Learning about voltage, current, and resistance. 
The relationship of the fundamentals through Ohm's Law.
LED Basics and Using the Multimeter.

Voltage is also referred to as potential difference
How to limit the current flowing through an LED using a resistor
How to use a resistor colour calculator to choose the right resistor
